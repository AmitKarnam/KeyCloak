	Long: `Keycloak is a powerful tool for managing encrypted secrets such as passwords, API keys, cloud credentials, and more. 

With Keycloak, you can securely store your secrets in the storage backend of your choice, thanks to its versatile secret engine. This engine not only encrypts your secrets but also handles their storage, providing an extra layer of security for your sensitive information.

The CLI tool provides an easy and efficient way to interact with Keycloak.

Keycloak is designed to make secret management as straightforward and secure as possible. Start using Keycloak today and take the first step towards better secret management.`,
